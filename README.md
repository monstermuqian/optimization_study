Here will I record the path that I learn the optimal theory by coding the algorithms with different language.

# Sequential Quadratic Programming

After hard working of two days I have almost implemented SQP-Algorithm with Python. Python-Package Numpy is being used. 
The rest work of completing the code is aimed to adapt the program with equation constraints. Because most parts about 
this algorithm are caused by inequation constraints, so to determine the total framework of the program I try to write 
the code by aiming at inequation constraints. ----28.01.2021
