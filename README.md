Here will I record the path that I learn the optimal theory by coding the algorithms with different language.

# Sequential Quadratic Programming with Python 3.8 and Numpy

After hard working of two days I have almost implemented SQP-Algorithm with Python. Python-Package Numpy is being used. 
The rest work of completing the code is aimed to adapt the program with equation constraints. Because most parts about 
this algorithm are caused by inequation constraints, so to determine the total framework of the program I try to write 
the code by aiming at inequation constraints.

All works are done and the program is now able to solve a linear optimization problem with whatever equation or 
inequation constraints. Some days I may improve the program with taylor expansion for dealing with nonlinear problem.

# Sequential Quadratic Programming with C++ and Eigen Library

After another hard working of 3 days I have implemented SQP algorithm with C++ and Eigen library. The aim of this work
is to learn about how to operate matrix with C++ language and to consolidate the my knowledge about numerical optimizaiton.
And then I would like to use this library on ROS to implement some Tracking Algorithms or Sensor Fusion algorithms. But 
there are still some tiny works to be finished such that I have to cover the case of eqution constraints and add some 
error raises.
